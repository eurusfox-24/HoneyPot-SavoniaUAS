Here you can see tools and ideas for getting access to the target machine, scanning port, networks, packages, info gathering 


1. whatweb IP-IP --aggression 3 -v --no-errors --log-verbose=results (scanning your network by internal IP using whatweb tool)

2. nmap <IP> (scanning all ports in the network using nmap tool)

3. reverseshell (hacking tool for getting remote access to the target machine)

4 .ssh (tool for getting remote access to the target)

5. gathering info tools (ping <IP or domain name>, nslookup <IP or domain name>)

6. arp -a utilizing this command you can check out all IPs of every device connected to your LAN 

7. A python code written by me for port scanning by IP addresses (super easy in use)
          import socket
          
          
          def scan(target, ports):
              print('\n' + ' Starting Scan for ' + str(target))
              for port in range(1, ports):
                  scan_port(target, port)
          
          def scan_port(ipaddress, port):
              try:
                  sock = socket.socket()
                  sock.connect((ipaddress, port))
                  print('[+] Port open ' +str(port))
                  port.close()
              except:
                  pass
          
          
          targets = input('[*] Enter targets to scan(split them by ,): ')
          ports = int(input('[*] Enter how many ports you want to scan: '))
          
          if ',' in targets:
              print('[*] Scanning multiple targets')
              for ip_addr in targets.split(','):
                  scan(ip_addr.strip(''), ports)
          
          else: 
              scan(targets, ports)


8. Nessus, it is a local host for scanning vulnerabilities of the PC
