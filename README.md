🔒 Isolated Network Security Lab: Raspberry Pi 5 Honeypot and Penetration TestThis repository serves as the centralized storage for configuration files, custom scripts, and essential reference materials used in our isolated network security lab built on Raspberry Pi 5 devices.⚠️ NOTE: The files within this repository cannot be cloned to instantly replicate the full physical hardware setup. This repo is intended to store digital assets required for running the lab environment, such as custom Python scripts, web server files, and configuration instructions.🎯 Project OverviewThe goal of this project is to simulate a small, isolated network environment to observe and log basic penetration testing activities against a controlled honeypot system. The entire setup utilizes four dedicated Raspberry Pi 5 devices running specialized operating systems to create a realistic, contained security testing ground.Network Architecture SummaryDeviceOperating SystemPrimary RoleHacking MachineParrot OS (or Kali/Raspbian)Execution of penetration testing tools and scripts.Honeypot SystemHoneyPiPassive monitoring, logging, and intrusion detection.Network RouterOpenWrtProviding an isolated, offline wireless subnet for the lab devices.Web ServerNGINX on Raspberry Pi OSReference model for a typical network service (no active interaction).🛠️ Components and Activities1. The Isolated Subnet (OpenWrt Router)The Raspberry Pi 5 running OpenWrt is configured to create an entirely self-contained, offline wireless network. This ensures that all testing activities are segregated from our main network and cannot unintentionally affect external resources or services.2. The Attacker (Parrot OS Machine)The Hacking Machine is responsible for executing the following activities against the Honeypot System:Port Scanning: Utilizing a custom Python script to scan for open ports on the HoneyPi device.Telnet Brute Force: Using the powerful Hydra tool to attempt to brute-force the Telnet login service on the honeypot.3. The Target (HoneyPi Honeypot)The HoneyPi system is configured to simulate and detect specific network vulnerabilities. It is set up to log activity targeting four main types of vulnerability, though we are only actively testing two:Vulnerability TypeStatus in LabDescriptionPort ScanningACTIVELogs all scanning attempts directed at the device's ports.TelnetACTIVEDetects and logs connection and brute-force attempts on the Telnet service (Port 23).FTPINACTIVEVulnerability supported by the honeypot, but not actively tested in this phase.VNC ConnectionINACTIVEVulnerability supported by the honeypot, but not actively tested in this phase.4. Logging & ReportingThe critical function of the HoneyPi is its logging system:Real-time Logging: All detected port scanning and Telnet brute-force attempts are logged.Email Notification: The honeypot is configured to automatically parse the logs and send an output summary via email to a dedicated account, providing instant, offline documentation of the simulated attack traffic.5. Reference Web Server (NGINX)A separate Raspberry Pi 5 runs a static web server powered by NGINX. It hosts an imaginary static website for a fictional company. This device serves purely as a realistic reference model within the isolated network but is not actively interacted with during the penetration testing exercises.Project FocusThe core objective of this project is to develop a low-interaction honeypot using HoneyPi and integrate it into a small, isolated network with the remaining devices. This setup allows us to actively showcase how honeypot technology works by capturing and analyzing real simulated attack traffic.For enhanced portability, all four Raspberry Pi 5 devices are housed in a small, custom-designed 3D printed enclosure, making the entire lab easy to transport for demonstrations.This project is for educational and ethical testing purposes only.
